# Ascender
Ascender provides a web-based user interface, REST API, and task engine built on top of [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible). It is based off the upstream project of [AWX](https://github.com/ansible/awx).

A separate installer is being released to ease the burden of installing Ascender. This installer will allow you to test Ascender on a single VM with [k3s](https://k3s.io/) (which will be installed on your behalf), or onto an existing Kubernetes cluster, requiring the appropriate kubeconfig file and prescribed namespace.

Contributing
------------
- It is recommended that all contributions be applied upstream first to [AWX](https://github.com/ansible/awx), to better support collaboration with the community.

Reporting Issues
----------------

- If you're experiencing a problem that you feel is a bug in Ascender or have ideas for improving Ascender, we encourage you to open a Github issue and share your feedback.
