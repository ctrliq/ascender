# Ascender
Ascender provides a web-based user interface, REST API, and task engine built on top of [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible). It is based off the upstream project of [AWX](https://github.com/ansible/awx).

A separate installer is available to ease installing Ascender. It can deploy Ascender on a single VM using [k3s](https://k3s.io/) (installed automatically), or onto AKS, DKP, EKS, GKE, k3s, RKE2, or OCP using a provided kubeconfig and namespace. See the installer repository at https://github.com/ctrliq/ascender-install.
