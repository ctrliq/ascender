# Git-based requirements - installed separately from requirements.txt
#
# IMPORTANT: Use PEP 440 format that matches pip-compile's normalized output:
#   name @ git+https://github.com/org/repo.git@branch
#
# Format rules:
#   - Package name MUST match pip's normalized form (hyphens, not dots/underscores)
#   - Extras go in the package name: pkg[extra1,extra2] @ git+...
#   - Extras MUST be sorted alphabetically and use hyphens (not underscores)
#   - Do NOT use the legacy #egg=name format
#
# Example:
#   WRONG: git+https://github.com/org/repo.git@devel#egg=my-package[foo,bar]
#   WRONG: my_package[bar,foo] @ git+https://github.com/org/repo.git@devel
#   RIGHT: my-package[bar,foo] @ git+https://github.com/org/repo.git@devel
#
# updater.sh uses these lines to comment out matching entries in requirements.txt
# so they are not installed twice (once from git, once from PyPI).
