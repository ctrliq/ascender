    Perform a sorted bulk update on model instances to avoid database deadlocks.
    This function was introduced to prevent deadlocks observed in the AWX Controller
    when concurrent jobs attempt to update different fields on the same `main_hosts` table.
    Specifically, deadlocks occurred when one process updated `last_job_id` while another
    simultaneously updated `ansible_facts`.
    By sorting updates ID, we ensure a consistent update order,
    which helps avoid the row-level locking contention that can lead to deadlocks
    in PostgreSQL when multiple processes are involved.
    Returns:
        int: The number of rows affected by the update.
